# Wallet-Notifier
Made in python, gives a toast notification if any of your crypto wallets receive anything (and auto copy's the txid if enabled)

Not very good yet because its in a very early stage of development.

Goals:
  executable version for people without python installed
  run in background in taskbar
  support btc,usdt,eth,doge,xmr,ltc
  make the pictures work

THIS CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK YET AGAIN VERY EARLY STAGE, JUST UPLOADED IT SO I DONT FORGET ABOUT IT! SHOULD NOT TAKE LONG TO MAKE!
